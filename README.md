This is the leetCode problem solutions repo.
I'm creating a repo with solutions for the leetCode.

This repo contains:
  1. Each Directory contains one leetCode issue.
  2. Inside the directory, there will be three files. (problem statement, main file, solution file.)
  3. The solution file will have code whether the main contains the main function.
  4. The main function will call the solution method.
